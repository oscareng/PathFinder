# PathFinder
Welcome to Pathfinder! This application was born from my fascination with pathfinding algorithms and my need to visualize complicated code in order to better understand it. I hope you enjoy playing around with this tool, as I certainly had a great time creating it. Please feel free to contact me with thoughts/criticisms.
